            Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. We'll lay
            all these little funky little things in there. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it.
            Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Play with
            the angles.

            You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. You're
            the greatest
            thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. I really recommend you use
            odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself.
            You
            can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. That's the way I look when I get
            home
            late; black and blue. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a
            two-inch brush.

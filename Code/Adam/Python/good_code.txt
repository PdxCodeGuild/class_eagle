What constitutes good code:
- no bugs, accepts a variety of different user inputs without crashing
- descriptive and concise variable and function names in snake case
- descriptive and concise comments, not necessarily for every line but every major section at least
- segment complex sections of code into separate functions
- imports should be at the top of the file
- indentation should be 4 spaces
- no unnecessary or convoluted code, no 'junk code' that's been commented out
- spaces around operators ("x = 10" not "x=10")
- avoid unnecessary parentheses ("if x == 10" not "if (x == 10)")
- labs are named consistently "lab01_turtle.py", "lab02_madlib.py" etc

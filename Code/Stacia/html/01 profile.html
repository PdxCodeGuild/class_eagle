        <p> Dio was born into abject poverty on the crule streets of Galavstan Texas. Underprivliaged and accustomed
            to a dog eat dog lifestyle on the streets, Dio found himself in the custody of animal control at a young
            age. With dwindling resources and and a high kill rate, Dio found himself at the mercy of a system that
            destroys unadoptable pit bulls.
            With his vary nature being cause for destruction Dio circumvented the system by passing himself off as a
            very large Chihuahua mix. The rouse was an obvious one, but with his un natrual chirisma it left
            adoption agents willing to belive the lie.
            Dio was agressivly friendly and found himself a one way ticket to Washington. He was adopted into his
            first home but returned in less than a day. His large size was a deturant to his wheel chair bound would
            be adopter. He has since found his forever home.

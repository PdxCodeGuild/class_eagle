            <h1>High School Robotics</h1>
            <p style="padding-top: 20px">
              In high school, I was a part of 2 seperate teams that competed in the <b>FIRST Tech Challenge</b> international robotics competition.
              From 2017-2020 I was on team 7776 "The Loose Screws", the only public school robotics team from Portland to attend the Worlds Competition in Houston.
              In Spring 2020, my school dissolved the team due to COVID-19 and budget restraints. In light of this, I founded my own team, 18461 "Off Topic Robotics"
              from 2020-2021. During these years, I was on the coding team, being the lead coder for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 seasons. We wrote our code in <b>Java</b>
              using the <b>Android Studio</b> IDE, <b>Trello</b> for project management, and <b>GitHub</b> for source control. All code is archived on my repository.

            <h1>The Northwest Advanced Programming Workshop (NWAPW)</h1>
            <p style="padding-top: 20px">
              In the summer of 2019 and the summer of 2020, I was lucky enough to be nominated by my Computer Science teacher to attend NWAPW. 
              NWAPW is an intensive four week session, where the best computer sciencestudents from around the Pacific Northwest are chosen 
              to attend. We pitch ideas in advance anonymously, then can vote anonymously on which project ideas are the most interesting to us.
              The event organizers then take that feedback and divide us into groups of 3-5 students. Then, over the four weeks, the students simple goal 
              is to turn their project into a reality. The only rule was: you cannot use any libraries, unless you understand fully how they work.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2019, I worked on the <b>PlantID</b> project. Where we trained a neural network to recogonize certain flowers from a picture you took, then
              port that data into an app for the user. Then, in 2020, I worked on the HobbyHub project, a social media app to conect users who have similar interests
              and hobbies to one another, when they are stuck at home in the pandemic.
